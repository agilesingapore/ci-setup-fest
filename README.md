ci-setup-fest
=============

A wee little toy Ruby app designed as the guinea pig for a series of experiments around setting up various OSS CI servers.

The app is nothing more than a Hello World implementation with an associated Rakefile providing tasks to:

* Execute automated tests (using RSpec)
* Check the quality of the code (using Reek)
